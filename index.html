    		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
    		<p>All too often, students across the nation get caught up in the tidal wave of responsibilities that is college. Many rise to the challenge. Many rise above that challenge. It is not just securing that high GPA but securing relevant job experience as well. It’s not just being involved in organizations outside of academia, but rising through the ranks and becoming a leader and shaping the future of that organization.</p>

			<p>Our purpose is to ask what we can do as students to do all of this and give back to the community that gave us such a valuable opportunity to enhance ourselves in higher education. We feel as though education is the difference-maker in a community and has the power to do more than simply help people learn facts about subjects. A community—a culture—that focuses on the education of its members can give someone the confidence in life to follow their aspirations and give back to those around them.</p>

        <h4 id="about">Who We Are</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>We are students who are willing to spend the time attempting to create an organization that will outlast our time at the University of Cincinnati. As students, we recognize the value of the coursework we have been enrolled in. The goal is to take that knowledge—in business, engineering, and computer science—and use it to enhance the educational opportunities in the Greater Cincinnati community. From elementary to collegiate, no matter whether the learning situation is traditional or not, we seek to help.</p>

		<p>To accomplish the development of education, we are partnered up with the Literacy Network of Greater Cincinnati. If our history and experiences with the Literacy Network have indicated anything, it is that they are a rising organization that truly cares about the people in our community. They are impassioned by the opportunity to give even one adult or child the tools to become a better reader. They recognize the dedication behind adults who come in for reading lessons solely to read their child a bedtime story, and each member of the staff works to match that effort.</p>

		<p>If you are a company interested in supporting our book drive that will run through this website, send blasts through social media, and have exposure to hundreds of students: please email uc.cbtb@gmail.com by March 15th.</p>

		<p>If you are a non-Greek student group looking to get involved, please email uc.cbtb@gmail.com by March 15th as well.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>The University of Cincinnati chapter of Compassion by the Book started formal operations in October of 2015. Since we are so new, there are several ways for you to get involved with us.</p>

		<p>We have the mindset that we are always in short supply of exceptionally driven students and passionate, experienced leaders in business. As a growing student group looking to establish itself, we are always looking for more bright individuals. If you are interested in joining our cause, please get in touch with us at uc.cbtb@gmail.com.</p>

		<p>If you have a more financial focus in mind, donations are welcomed and accepted. Any amount can and will make a difference. In addition, we would be infinitely grateful to companies looking to support us or sponsor events in our time of growth. Even if financial aid is not an option, any exposure or backing would be an incredible boost to our organization.</p>
